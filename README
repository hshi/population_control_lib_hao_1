population_control_lib_hao_1
============================

The c++ library can be used for general population control in QMC.

This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

In order to use the library, we need to set up a class T for walker.
1. Member variables of T are pointer, point to those need population control.
2. There are pack() and unpack() member function to pack the data and unpack the data.
3. There is a member variable Nbuf, means size of pack.
4. Equal asignment function.

There is an example of class T in this library in double_pop_type.h and double_pop_type.cpp
